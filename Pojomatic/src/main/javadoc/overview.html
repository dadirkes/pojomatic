Pojomatic is a library which allows simple creation of the three methods
{@link Object#equals(Object)}, {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#toString()} by
annotating properties.  There are two steps to pojomatize a pojo class: annotating, and implementing
the three methods.

<h2>Annotations</h2>
Pojomatic behavior is controlled by annotations; these can be on a property-by-property basis, a
class-wide basis, or a mix of the two. Class wide behavior can be controlled by the
{@link org.pojomatic.annotations.AutoProperty AutoProperty} and
{@link org.pojomatic.annotations.PojoFormat PojoFormat}, while property-specific behavior can be
controlled by the {@link org.pojomatic.annotations.Property Property} and
{@link org.pojomatic.annotations.PojoFormat PropertyFormat} annotations.  A recommended practice is
to provide an {@code AutoProperty} annotation at the class level, and the override the behavior it
specifies on a per-property basis as needed.  This minimizes both the number of annotations needed,
as well as the number of additional steps needed when adding new properties to a class.
