  Pojomatic Test Utils provide an enhancement to the traditional {@code assertEquals} method seen in
  unit test libraries, in the form of a new method, {@code assertEqualsWithDiff}.  This new method has
  the same basic behavior as the original, with the added feature that if the two objects being
  asserted to be equal are in fact not equal, but have types compatible for equality, then the
  message of the thrown {@code AssertionError} will include the differences between the two objects
  as determined by {@link Pojomatic#diff(Object, Object)}.
</p>
<p>
  Because Junit and TestNG disagree as to the order of the expected and actual parameters to
  {@code assertEquals}, two {@code PojomaticAssert} classes are provided:
  {@link org.pojomatic.junit.PojomaticAssert} and {@link org.pojomatic.testng.PojomaticAssert}.
