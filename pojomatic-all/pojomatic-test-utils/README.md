PojomaticTestUtils
=============
PojomaticTestUtils provides utilities to help with writing tests for, or using, classes which use Pojomatic. This library includes classes with JUnit and TestNG style `assertEquals` methods which include differences (via `Pojomatic.diff(Object, Object))` in the error message if the assertion fails.

For more information and examples, see the JavaDocs.
